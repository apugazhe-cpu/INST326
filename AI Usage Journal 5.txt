Week 5
This week I used AI to help me with my linear algebra homework
Here is the link to the chat: https://claude.ai/chat/23a832d2-fd71-4c85-91e2-431d8c144033
I finished all the multiple choice problems with ease but the last 2 questions were tough so I asked claude to help me and I understood
how to solve the problems
