Week 4
This week I used AI to help me with my english homework
Here is the link to the chat: https://chatgpt.com/c/68dfd459-ef08-8327-9436-b304ef015ff5
I was a little confused on how to give examples on rhetorical strategies and explain how it appeals to the audience
I got a clear reference from this chat and used it as inspiration to finish my worksheet
I have also used Claude to help me with the last couple of questions on this weeks exercises
